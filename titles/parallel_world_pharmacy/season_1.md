## Overview

A famous medical researcher in modern Japan works himself to death trying to save humanity from conflicting diseases. He wakes up reincarnated as Falma de Médicis, the son of a noble court pharmacist in a fantasy world. He discovers he has been blessed by the God of Medicine with unlimited divine arts and the ability to diagnose illnesses and create chemical substances.

## Story & Narrative

**(Episode 1)**
The premise is a classic isekai but with a very focused medical twist. The contrast between his previous overworked life where he lost his sister to illness and his new opportunity to cure people with magic is compelling. The scene where he discovers his powers (and the lack of a shadow) sets up a nice mystery about the nature of his reincarnation.

## Characters & Development

**Falma de Médicis** seems to be a protagonist driven by genuine altruism rather than just power fantasy. His motivation comes from his past trauma of losing his sister.

## Production & Direction

The animation is clean and pleasant. The depiction of the magic and the "diagnostic eye" effect was handled well.

## Themes & Impact

- Medical Ethics in a fantasy setting.
- The gap between modern science and traditional fantasy medicine.

## Episode Breakdown

### Episode 1: The Boy Reincarnated in Another World and the Pharmacy of Another World
- **Rating:** ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- **Notes:** Good setup. He realizes he's in a different body and world. Discovering his "creation" and "deletion" powers. He decides to use his knowledge to save people, starting with his new mother? (or at least diagnosing). The magic system seems tied to chemical structures which is cool for a pharmacist.

## Personal Notes & Observations

- "A pharmacist who was trying to create a medicine so that everyone who is sick can fight with the disease without worry unlike his sister who died without receiving medication." - This motivation hits hard.
- The concept of "unlimited magic (divine) power" is a bit OP, but since it's used for healing, it's interesting.

### Memorable Moments

- Realizing he has no shadow.
- Creating water and destroying it.
